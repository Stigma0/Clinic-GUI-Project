# Clinic-GUI-Project

It is a basic clinic Project with SQLite Database. This application combines a React frontend with an ASP.NET backend, created for patients getting appointments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Windows (This project was developed in Windows due to ASP.net being easier to manage there)
- Node.js and npm (for the React frontend)
- .NET 5.0 SDK or later (for the ASP.NET backend)
- A suitable IDE (e.g., Visual Studio for ASP.NET and React)
- SQLite

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:

#### Setting up the backend

1. Navigate to the ASP.NET project directory
2. Restore dependencies:
